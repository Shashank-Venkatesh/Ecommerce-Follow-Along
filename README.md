MILESTONE 1 PROJECT OVERVIEW

---

## Project Overview  

This project is a **MERN Stack** application designed to deliver a robust, scalable, and efficient solution. The application incorporates **RESTful APIs** for seamless communication between the frontend and backend, implements **database schemas** for structured data management, and ensures secure **authentication** mechanisms for user interaction.  

### Key Features:  
1. **MERN Stack Implementation:**  
   - **MongoDB:** For managing data storage with flexible, schema-based modeling.  
   - **Express.js:** A lightweight and fast web framework for building the server-side application.  
   - **React.js:** For developing a dynamic and responsive frontend user interface.  
   - **Node.js:** Enables efficient backend services with asynchronous capabilities.  

2. **RESTful API Integration:**  
   - APIs are designed following REST principles, ensuring modular and reusable endpoints.  
   - Supports CRUD operations to interact with the database.  
   - Error handling and input validation implemented to enhance reliability.  

3. **Database Schemas:**  
   - Schemas are carefully structured to maintain consistency and optimize data querying.  
   - Relationships between entities are clearly defined for seamless interaction.  
   - Data is validated at the schema level to ensure integrity and prevent malicious entries.  

4. **Authentication:**  
   - User authentication is handled securely using modern techniques.  
   - Supports both **registration** and **login** functionalities.  
   - Passwords are hashed and stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.  
   - Role-based authentication to manage permissions and access control effectively.  

### Objectives:  
- To provide a seamless user experience through a responsive and intuitive interface.  
- To maintain high-performance standards with optimized database queries and backend processes.  
- To prioritize security, ensuring data privacy and preventing unauthorized access.  

### Tech Stack:  
- **Frontend:** React.js with state management, React Router, and reusable components.  
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for scalable and efficient API development.  
- **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose for schema design and data validation.  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user session management.

**Milestone 1: **

Project Overview In this milestone, we introduced the foundations of building a full-stack e-commerce application using the MERN stack. Key topics covered include:

Overview of the MERN Stack The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building modern, scalable, and fast web applications. The stack consists of: MongoDB (database) Express.js (backend framework) React.js (frontend library) Node.js (JavaScript runtime) The key advantage of MERN is its JavaScript-only approach, where both the front-end and back-end are built using JavaScript, making development easier and more efficient.
REST API Structure and Endpoints We explored REST APIs (Representational State Transfer) and their role in allowing communication between the client and server. Key API endpoints were introduced to handle: User Authentication: Register and log in users with secure authentication. Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data. Order Handling: Manage customer orders from creation to checkout. These APIs interact with the database, responding with data in JSON format.
Basics of Database Schema Design In MongoDB, schema design involves defining the structure of data stored in the database, including relationships between different collections such as users, products, and orders. The schema plays a critical role in ensuring data consistency and making it easier to query.
Role of Authentication in Web Applications Authentication verifies the identity of a user before granting access to certain features or data. In this project, we focused on building secure authentication mechanisms, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their orders. We implemented techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to securely handle user sessions. Features Implemented User Authentication:
Sign up and login features using JWT for secure sessions. Product Management:

Add, update, and view products within the e-commerce platform. Order Management:

Create, update, and view customer orders.

Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page

In this milestone, we focused on setting up the initial front-end structure and implementing the login page for the application. Key achievements include:

Front-End Framework: Set up the React framework with Vite for a fast and modern development experience. Folder Structure: Organized the src folder to include separate directories for components, pages, and assets to improve scalability and maintainability. Login Page Implementation: Developed a basic login page (Login.jsx) that includes a user interface for email and password input. Incorporated validation logic to ensure proper user input. Routing: Implemented React Router for navigation and created routes for the login and signup pages. Styling: Added basic styling using CSS (App.css) to ensure a clean and user-friendly design. Git Integration: Added the new files to version control and committed progress to the GitHub repository. This milestone lays the groundwork for creating the front-end interface and interaction logic for the application.
